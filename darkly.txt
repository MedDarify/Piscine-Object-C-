==> Sign in form Bruteforce

How to exploit the breach
From there we could perform any operation we want inside the application, 
authenticated as the hacked user.

For example for mailBox account we could send 
emails impersonating the hacked user.

And overall we could even change the user's password 
depending on the application security rigor.

How to avoid the breach
Several solution or good practices exist, such as limiting 
the amount of request from the same IP or adding a recaptcha usage on the form.

2FA authentication such a google Authenticator, requesting the user to 
validate it's identity on one of his other devices.

==> Directory traversal breach
How to exploit the breach
By being able to browse the server file system the hacker could 
steal any kind of sensitive information. 
He could also be able to execute previously uploaded 
script inside the server file tree.

How to avoid the breach
The solutions to avoid this breach are quite similar to those for 
Redirect security breach. The server should not build a path to local 
filesystem with user-supplied input.

If it's necessary for the application to allow users to access files on 
the filesystem of the server, the server should validate the path sent 
by the user, to only allow access to authorized directories.
